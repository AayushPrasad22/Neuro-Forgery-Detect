# üõ°Ô∏è RFID-Net: A Robust Image Forgery Detection Network

## ‚ú® Project Overview

In an era where digital visual content is ubiquitous, the integrity of images is paramount. This project introduces **RFID-Net**, a cutting-edge deep learning model meticulously designed to detect subtle and sophisticated manipulations within digital images. Leveraging advanced neural network architectures, RFID-Net aims to distinguish genuine images from doctored ones by identifying inconsistencies and anomalies introduced during the forgery process. Our goal is to contribute to a more trustworthy digital ecosystem by providing a robust tool for image forensics.

## üöÄ Features

* **Advanced Forgery Detection:** Employs a deep neural network to identify various types of image forgeries (e.g., splicing, copy-move, removal).
* **Noise Residual Analysis:** Specifically designed to analyze inherent noise patterns and their disruptions, which are key indicators of tampering.
* **Comprehensive Dataset Support:** Trained and evaluated using widely recognized image forensics datasets such as CASIA 2.0, Columbia, and NIST.
* **Modular & Extensible Codebase:** Organized Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks ensure clarity, ease of understanding, and potential for future enhancements.
* **User-Friendly Setup:** Simplified steps to get the project up and running quickly.
