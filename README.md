# 🛡️ RFID-Net: A Robust Image Forgery Detection Network

## ✨ Project Overview

In an era where digital visual content is ubiquitous, the integrity of images is paramount. This project introduces **RFID-Net**, a cutting-edge deep learning model meticulously designed to detect subtle and sophisticated manipulations within digital images. Leveraging advanced neural network architectures, RFID-Net aims to distinguish genuine images from doctored ones by identifying inconsistencies and anomalies introduced during the forgery process. Our goal is to contribute to a more trustworthy digital ecosystem by providing a robust tool for image forensics.

## 🚀 Features

* **Advanced Forgery Detection:** Employs a deep neural network to identify various types of image forgeries (e.g., splicing, copy-move, removal).
* **Noise Residual Analysis:** Specifically designed to analyze inherent noise patterns and their disruptions, which are key indicators of tampering.
* **Comprehensive Dataset Support:** Trained and evaluated using widely recognized image forensics datasets such as CASIA 2.0, Columbia, and NIST.
* **Modular & Extensible Codebase:** Organized Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks ensure clarity, ease of understanding, and potential for future enhancements.
* **User-Friendly Setup:** Simplified steps to get the project up and running quickly.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment and run the RFID-Net project.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Python 3.8+** (Recommended version)
* **Git**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AayushPrasad22/RFID-Net--Robust-Image-Forgery-Detection.git](https://github.com/AayushPrasad22/RFID-Net--Robust-Image-Forgery-Detection.git)
    cd RFID-Net--Robust-Image-Forgery-Detection
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (highly recommended for dependency management):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS / Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 📂 Dataset

The core of RFID-Net's training and evaluation relies on specialized image forgery datasets.

* **Location:** The `Dataset/` directory within this repository contains the structured image data.
* **Included Subsets:** This typically includes images from known forensics benchmarks such as `CASIA 2.0`, `Columbia`, and `NIST`.
* **External Link (if applicable):** If the full dataset exceeds GitHub's size limits or requires external download, please refer to `DatasetLink.txt` for instructions or download URLs.

## 🚀 Usage

### Training the Model

To train your own RFID-Net model, execute the `train.py` script:

```bash
python train.py
(Optional: If your train.py script accepts arguments for training, you can provide examples here, e.g., python train.py --epochs 100 --batch_size 32)

Trained models and associated data will be saved in the model/ and model1/ directories.

Running Inference & Evaluation
To test the trained model on new images or evaluate its performance:

Bash

python rifd.py [path/to/your/image.jpg]
# Or, if you have a dedicated testing script:
# python test_model.py
(Optional: If rifd.py or your testing script takes arguments for image paths, output directories, etc., explain them here.)

You can also explore testimages.ipynb for detailed testing procedures and visualization of results.

Exploring with Jupyter Notebooks
The project includes several Jupyter Notebooks for interactive exploration, development, and analysis:

noise_clean.ipynb: Dive deep into the noise residual extraction process and data preparation.

RIFDNet.ipynb: Understand the RFID-Net architecture, layer by layer, and experiment with its components.

testimages.ipynb: A comprehensive notebook for running tests, analyzing outputs, and visualizing forgery detection results.

To open the notebooks:

Bash

jupyter notebook
Then, navigate to the desired .ipynb file in your browser.
